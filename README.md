Installation Video [I need to update this with some missing parts]: https://youtu.be/zJnpfzSowlE

~~Before installation, you need to install WinPcap from https://www.winpcap.org/~~ (No longer needed)

After downloading the SPPD Deck Tracker, you may need to Unblock the DLLs in libpcap and libpcap/_platform: https://i.imgur.com/dKJEAfd.png

  * If you insist on using Bluestacks, download, install and ROOT Bluestacks
    * Root directions here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hneUrKMMaDc
    * Note: If you get an error while launching SPPD about "Invalid License", then you have to reinstall SPPD. (something about rooting the device makes it happen)
  * Download from the app store: "Root Certificate Manager" (phone should be rooted first)

	  * This is an example link. Your actual IP Address is listed in the deck tracker SETTINGS tab.
	  * Download the certificate, but don't bother trying to install it, because you can't anyways.
	* Now open the app "Root Certificate Manager", and Import the certificate (.cer) file you just downloaded.
	* Now you're ready to use all of the features of the deck tracker.
  * Note: Each time after you set the proxy, you have do a *full restart* of bluestacks
    * Exit Bluestacks by click 'Quit' from the bluestacks icon in the system tray (near the clock).
